This is a repository created for BYU's STAT 386 Data Science class. 
Hopefully, this will be a functional albeit possibly not very pretty 
readme file to describe the purpose of this repo, subject to change.

This file also should render as a markdown (.md) file where appropriate, 
with associated features: **bold**, *italics*, _alt italics with 
underscores_, and even <sup>superscripts</sub>!

> Redditors may find this familiar...
